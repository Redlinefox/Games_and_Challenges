# Python Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe built with Python in Jupyter Notebook

//updated on 12/22/2020 with a replay function to allow consecutive games
//There appears to be a bug in the Jupyter Notebook which occasionally causes the input field to jump to the top of the cell

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe
Player 1 has the X tokens and goes first
Player 2 has the O tokens and goes second
If either player wishes to end game they can type 'End'

Each player can select a number that corresponds with the square below   
[1, 2, 3]   
[4, 5, 6]   
[7, 8, 9]   

which will then print their 'X' or 'O' to the following grid
